The issue arises when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener in conjunction with React's `useEffect` hook.  If the listener is not properly cleaned up, it can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior, particularly when navigating between routes or unmounting components.  The problem is exacerbated when multiple `onAuthStateChanged` listeners are attached without proper removal.
